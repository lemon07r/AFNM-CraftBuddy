# AFNM Modding Reference (Imported)

This subtree is a curated AFNM modding reference subset retained for CraftBuddy.

For AFNM-CraftBuddy implementation decisions, use:

1. code/tests
2. `docs/project/*`

Use this subtree only when you need additional upstream context.

The full imported snapshot is archived at `archive/reference/afnm-modding-full/`.
