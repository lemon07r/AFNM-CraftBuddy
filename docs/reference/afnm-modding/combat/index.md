# Combat System

CraftBuddy only needs a narrow slice of combat documentation for shared effect schema context.

## Retained pages

- **[Effect Types](effects)** - All available buff effect types with examples
- **[Technique System](techniques)** - active technique/effect structure reference

The rest of the imported combat subtree was archived to keep active docs lean.
