# AFNM Modding Reference Corpus

This directory intentionally keeps only the CraftBuddy-relevant subset of imported AFNM docs.

## Rules

- Reference-only context.
- Not authoritative for CraftBuddy implementation.
- Verify anything used here against current project code/tests.

## Retained subset

- `docs/reference/afnm-modding/CRAFTING_SHORTLIST.md`
- `docs/reference/afnm-modding/concepts/modapi.md`
- `docs/reference/afnm-modding/concepts/scaling.md`
- `docs/reference/afnm-modding/crafting/*`
- `docs/reference/afnm-modding/combat/effects.md`
- `docs/reference/afnm-modding/combat/techniques.md`

## Full snapshot archive

The larger imported AFNM reference snapshot is preserved at:

- `archive/reference/afnm-modding-full/`

It is intentionally excluded from active docs checks and should only be used when the curated subset is insufficient.
