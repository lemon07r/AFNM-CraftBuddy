# Docs Index

## Primary entrypoints

- `docs/README.md` - overview of documentation structure
- `docs/project/START_HERE_FOR_AGENTS.md` - fastest technical onboarding path

## Documentation sections

- `docs/project/` - authoritative implementation docs
- `docs/dev-requests/` - game developer API exposure requests + status
- `docs/history/` - historical snapshots (non-authoritative)
- `docs/reference/` - curated AFNM reference subset (reference-only)
- `archive/` - full imported snapshots/deprecated docs (traceability only)

Use `docs/project/*` as source of truth for implementation work.
