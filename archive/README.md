# Archive

This directory stores large or deprecated documentation snapshots that are intentionally excluded from active docs validation and inventory generation.

## Contents

- `reference/afnm-modding-full/`: full imported AFNM modding corpus snapshot
- `deprecated/AGENT.md`: previous root agent guidance file retained for traceability

Use `docs/project/*` and `docs/reference/*` first for implementation work.
